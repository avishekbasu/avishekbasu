# About me
I’m a researcher working on pulsars and time-series analysis, with experience across radio and high-energy astrophysics. My work focuses on extracting weak physical signals from noisy data, building reproducible analysis pipelines, and combining statistical modelling with efficient computation. I’m increasingly interested in large-scale data analysis and modern data tools alongside scientific research.

I did my PhD from the [NCRA-TIFR] (http://www.ncra.tifr.res.in/ncra/main).
