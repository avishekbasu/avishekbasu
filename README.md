# About me
I work in time-domain astronomy, with a focus on pulsars and time-series analysis across radio and high-energy astrophysics. My research centres on extracting weak physical signals from noisy data, developing reproducible analysis pipelines, and combining statistical modelling with efficient computation. 

Alongside my scientific work, I’m increasingly interested in large-scale data analysis and modern data tools, particularly where they intersect with rigorous, physics-driven research.

Before joining the [University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/) as a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the [Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics](https://www.jodrellbank.manchester.ac.uk/) , I completed my PhD in Physics at the [NCRA–TIFR](http://www.ncra.tifr.res.in/ncra/main).
